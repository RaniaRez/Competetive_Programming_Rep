class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        '''
        freq=defaultdict(int)
        for char in s:
            freq[char]+=1
I used default dict at the beginning, but Counter is better in performance
     '''  
        freq= Counter(s)
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            if freq[char]==1:
                return i
